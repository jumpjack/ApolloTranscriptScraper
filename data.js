Because the Command Module attitude relative to Earth changes as Mike maneuvers so that he can track the LM, the antenna must be moved to maintain pointing. However, the system of gimbals used to point the antenna has physical limits and Houston is telling Mike that, at some point during the descent, one or more of those limits will be reached. In order to re-acquire the high-gain, Mike would have to change the spacecraft attitude and, because he can maintain voice communications with both Earth and Eagle on his omni-directional antennas and because Houston will be pre-occupied with the landing, no attitude adjustment will be made.]<p>\n\n[Comm Break.

We measured omega by measuring the speed at which an object on the ground passed through a certain number of degrees on the (LPD) grid on the window. We just timed it on a stopwatch and had a little plot to compare it with. As the altitude decreased, we could see it was converging pretty well. It gave us an alternate check of our altitude. The importance of this is that, if we weren't in a reasonably close altitude band to our intended starting altitude, the landing guidance would not necessarily converge - the solution wouldn't converge - so it was important to us at that point that the altitude be about right when we started.&quot;]</i>"

Your sense of well-being is generated by the degree of familiarity you have with what might go wrong in a challenging way. To me, when you're doing what we were doing for the first time, there's a level of importance that's a good bit different from the second or third time, because it has been done already and because the world has seen it. When you're part of the pioneering effort, there's a focusing of an individual's concentration and level of attention that is at the exclusion of a lot of other things. It's a kind of gun-barrel vision.&quot;]<p>\n\n[The 15 July 1969 Apollo 11 Crew Training Summary indicates that out of 959 hours of training, Neil spent 285 hours - 30 percent - in the various LM simulators.  Buzz did 1017 hours of training, of which 332 hours - 33 percent -  was spent in the LM simulators.   These figures do not include Neil's LLTV flights nor the 56 hours each of them spent in briefings about LM systems.]<p>\n\n[Armstrong - &quot;I would add, along that same line, that the time requirements necessitated that we accept the conclusions and recommendations of the crews that went before us. So, we did not spend an extraordinary amount of time on things that had already been done and had worked as expected. We focused a great deal of our attention on those things which had not been done before and which we would be expected to pass on to the crews behind us.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Aldrin - &quot;Whether they wanted it or not.&quot;]<p>\n\n[NASA photo S69-35504 shows Neil, Mike and Buzz debriefing the Apollo 10 crew on 3 June 1969, about a week after Tom Stafford, John Young, and Gene Cernan returned from the Moon.

Certainly the switches were in the right positions. They hadn't been changed since pre-launch. But we did, in fact, go to the Descent position on the antenna and leave it there for a half a minute or so, and then go back to Auto and that cleared the alarm.&quot;]<p>\n\n[O'Brien - &quot;The landing radar could be moved between two positions: Before pitchover, the radar was in the Descent position, and as the LM rotated to a more upright attitude during the approach phase, the radar was moved to the Hover position. These positions could be commanded manually, in addition to the Auto setting, where the radar was under the control of the guidance computer. The purpose of moving the radar was to keep the antenna pointed as directly towards the surface as possible.&quot;]</i>"

And in this case in the real flight, we are spring-loaded to the land position.&quot;]<p>\n\n[David Woods has provided scans of pages 15 and 16 from the Apollo 15 Lunar Module Cue Cards, which cover various abort scenarios.

It is not a typo for 'P30', which is a program for setting up a burn.]<p>\n\n[In Houston, Steve Bales, the control room's expert in the LM guidance systems, has determined that the landing will not be jeopardized by the overflow. The overflow consists of an unexpected flow of data concerning rendezvous radar pointing. The computer has been programmed to recognize this data as being of secondary importance and will ignore it while it does more important computations. In my first draft of this paragraph, I described Bales as &quot;a young expert&quot;.]<p>\n\n[Armstrong - &quot;I don't doubt that Steve was a 'young expert' (he was 26), but Steve probably wasn't much different in age than most all of the other guys in the MOCR (Mission Operations Control Room).&quot;]<p>\n\n[Journal Contributor Stephanie Hanus notes that Gene Kranz describes in his book </I>Failure is Not an Option<I> the final simulation done prior to the mission, with Dave Scott and Jim Irwin in the LM simulator.

But, as best I can recall, whatever the flight director people had known about this alarm potential coming up and which were Go and which were not, I was the kind of the systems guy in the LM and I was not made aware of that.

Buzz is reading a computer display which indicates where on the vertical scale Neil should look to find the place where the computer thinks the LM will land.][Randy Attwood has provide a photo of the LPD scale in LM-9, the H-mission-capable vehicle scheduled for Apollo 15 before that flight became a J-mission.][During the other Apollo landings, pitchover gave the Commanders their first looks at the landing site. Then, they could re-target the LM using the Landing Point Designator (LPD). If they twitched the handcontroller forward, the computer would move its target downrange by a small increment and similarly to the right, left, or uprange.][Fjeld - &quot;One blip of the handcontroller moved the target 1/2 degree up/downrange or 2 degrees left/right per blip. The increments were all changed to 1 degree for Apollo 15 and the later flights.&quot;][Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;Normally, in this period of time - that is, from P64 onward, we'd be evaluating the landing site and checking our position and starting LPD activity. However, the concern here was not with the landing area we were going into but, rather, whether we could continue at all (because of the program alarms). Consequently, our attention was directed toward clearing the program alarms, keeping the machine flying, and assuring ourselves that control was adequate to continue without requiring an abort. Most of the attention was directed inside the cockpit during this time period and, in my view, this would account for our inability to study the landing site and final landing location during the final descent. It wasn't until we got below 2000 feet that we were actually able to look out and view the landing area.&quot;][Readers should note that only Neil is looking out the window. As mentioned previously, Buzz has his attention focused entirely on the computer. Neil's use of 'we' in this context is consistent with his general tendency to deflect attention from himself, even in situations like the Technical Debrief where the only people present were his crewmates, other astronauts, and various engineers.][Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;In the early phases of P64, I did find time to go out of Auto control and check the manual control in both pitch and yaw and found its response to be satisfactory. I zeroed the error needles and went back into Auto. I continued the descent in Auto...We proceeded on the flashing 64 and obtained LPD availability, but we did not use it because we really weren't looking outside the cockpit during this phase. As we approached the 1500-foot point, the program alarm seemed to be settling down and we committed ourselves to continue. We could see the landing area and the point at which the LPD was pointing, which was indicating we were landing just short (and slightly north) of a large rocky crater   surrounded with the large boulder field with very large rocks covering a high percentage of the surface. I initially felt that that might be a good landing area if we could stop short of that crater, because it would have more scientific value to be close to a large crater. (However), continuing to monitor the LPD, it became obvious that I could not stop short enough to find a safe landing area.&quot;][Armstrong and Aldrin, from the Crew Observations chapter of the Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report - &quot;This crater was later identified as one we had informally called West Crater during our prelaunch training.&quot;][The 1970 book, </i>First on the Moon<i>, attributed to Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin but assembled by Life magazine writers Gene Farmer and Dora Jane Hamblin, includes the following quotation from geologist Eugene Shoemaker (on page 296 in the 'Book Club' edition): &quot;Tracking information indicated that Neil had flown past the middle of the landing ellipse and was several kiometers downrange.  We knew that he had flown over a blocky-rim crater, that he had seen rays of ejecta as he passed over, and that the landing pattern (ground track?) had been rather like a fish hook.  There were maybe six craters which could fit his description, but once we knew he was downrange we narrowed it to two.  I believe that it was (geologist) Marita West, over in Building No. 2, who first suggested that the crater Neil had described was West Crater.  All of us came to the same conclusion pretty rapidly.&quot;][As Neil will discuss at 102:55:16, the boulder field surrounding West Crater contains rocks up to 2 to 3 meters in size, big enough to cause the LM some real problems.  On a detail from a 300 dpi scan of a Xerox copy of 1:5000 LM Lunar Surface Map LSE 2-48, I have marked what is probably a boulder just east of West Crater.  The grid squares on this 1:5000 map are 50 meters on a side and the north-south size of the boulder is about 1-2 meters and close to the resolution limit.][Armstrong - &quot;My guess is that the outer northeast slope of West Crater is where it was taking us.&quot;][Fjeld - &quot;On the main, vertical index line of the LPD, hash marks are painted at 2 degrees intervals. Lesser increments have to be eyeballed. Use of the LPD was tough enough with even a stable platform, but the LM has been in a constant slow pitch since P64 and the LPD numbers Neil is getting from Buzz are as much as 2 seconds old. In addition, one to two degree per second motions caused by propellant sloshing is making use of the LPD, I believe, futile! Post-mission analysis showed that the actual computer target is more than 500 feet west/northwest of where Neil thinks the LM is taking him.&quot;][Aldrin - &quot;If you don't like what you see, there are maybe four classes of alternatives: left, right, down (short), or go over. And, overwhelmingly, the less traumatic one is to go over, even though there may be some question 'Well, if I go over, then I don't know where it is.' Whereas, if I land short of it, then I know where it is. I'm not on it, I'm in front of it. As I try to reconstruct it, going right is a hairy thing, going left is a hairy thing, and coming down and stopping (short)...since, to stop, really...&quot;][Armstrong - &quot;You got to go dead...You can't see very well...&quot;][Aldrin - &quot;And you might drive yourself into a...You know, it's just a bad deal.&quot;][Armstrong - &quot;You might get down there and find out 'Jesus, I've got a terrible situation.'&quot;][Aldrin &quot;Right. Right. So the easier, the much more natural (thing to do) is to easily fly over.&quot;][Armstrong &quot;Extend it.&quot;][Aldrin - &quot;Where, in retrospect, that's the one that eats up more fuel. I would suspect that Pete and the rest of the guys coming along afterwards paid a lot more attention to thoughts of fuel consumption than we did.&quot;][Armstrong - &quot;Probably.&quot;][Post-flight analysis indicated that Neil landed with about 770 pounds of fuel remaining. Of this total, about 100 pounds would have been unusable. As indicated in an unnumbered figure from page 9-24 in the Apollo 11 Mission Report, the remainder would have been enough for about 45 seconds, including about 20 seconds for an abort. Naturally, Neil had no intention of aborting.][The mission plan had PDI at 102:35:13 and the landing at 102:47:11, for a total burn of 11 minutes 58 seconds. In reality, PDI was at 102:33:07 with the landing at 102:45:41.  The burn lasted 12 minutes 34 seconds, 36 seconds longer than planned, with virtually all the difference due to Neil's decision to fly beyond the boulder field. The longer burn was equivalent to using roughly 530 pounds of fuel. Had Neil not landed long, he would have had about 1190 of usable fuel remaining. The other five Commanders all landed with roughly 1100 to 1200 pounds of usable fuel remaining.][O'Brien - &quot;The large difference between the post-flight analysis and the critical, low-fuel situation that appeared to exist - but didn't - was due to fuel sloshing in the tanks. As Neil pitched the LM over to fly past the crater, the propellant-quantity measuring devices could not accurately gauge the amount left in the tanks.&quot;][Fjeld - &quot;At the time of Apollo 11, each of the tanks had a small cruciform baffle near the anti-vortex can at the base, right next to the hole for the Propellant Quantity Gauge. Studies were done, early in LEM development, with a clear plastic tank half full that revealed that the slosh dynamics were not too severe and that the small vortex baffles were sufficient to keep propellant slosh at bay.][&quot;Well, we all know what happened on Apollo 11.  Slosh uncovered the Quantity Gauge, latching the light early, losing the crew half a minute of flight time. It also made the LPD unreliable. Apollo 12 flew with the same configuration and its Quantity light came on early, exactly the same way! Worse, Pete actually used the LPD to redesignate his landing, but he maneuvered ",

If you have done any work on a computer that just has a switch register and display (such as an IMSAI, ALTAIR or one of my favorites, the KIM-1), you'd be comfortable with the AGS.&quot;]<p>\n\n[&quot;The way the AGS operated is that you had only an address and data display, 0-9 keypad, a Clear button, plus +/-, Enter and Readout. That's it. The ultimate in simple interfaces! How the AGS was operated was to press Clear, then a memory address. On a 5-octal character display, you got what was stored in that location. To change it, you typed a +/-, followed by 5 characters. Pressing Enter stored the value directly into memory. What you hear is the checklist item noted as: 413+10000. The key sequence is Clear, 413, Enter, +10000, Enter.&quot;]<p>\n\n[&quot;Address 413 contains the variable that indicates that the LM has landed - so any abort will be from the surface - which further tells the AGS to save the attitude information from its gyros. These gyros were 'strap-down' types, which means that they had a fixed orientation with respect to the LM body. They also had a nasty habit of drifting quite a bit. So, as soon as they landed, the AGS was to 'lock in', if you will, the attitude the LM was in. If the PGNS died - and it was the PGNS that oriented and re-aligned the AGS - at least they would have some approximate attitude information to abort with.&quot;]</i>"

Or you have a propellant tank pressure problem, or something that would cause us to go quickly.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Following our review of the landing, I asked Neil about the value of the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle and it similar predecessor, the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle. These free-flying craft (shown here with test pilot Joe Walker at the controls) were built for NASA by Bell Aerosystems, Buffalo, NY and had a General Electric CF-700-2V jet engine mounted pointing downward so that, in effect, it removed 5/6th of the vehicle weight. According to Journal Contributor Ed Hengeveld, &quot;lift for the remaining one-sixth of the LLTV's weight was provided by two 2250 Newton hydrogen peroxide lift rockets.&quot; Like the LM engine, these lift engines could be gimbaled. The vehicle also had sets of thrusters. A landing in the LLTV was not an exact duplicate of a LM landing on the Moon, but the two vehicles did share many performance similarities. Two LLRVs and three LLTVs were built and three crashed during test flights and training. All of the pilots - including Neil in the first of the three accidents - ejected safely. See, also, Gene Cernan's discussion of the LLTV at 113:43:49 in the Apollo 17 Journal.]<p>\n\n[As of August 2004, the surviving LLTV was on display in the lobby of Building 2 at NASA Johnson.  John Osborn has provided an extensive set of photos.]<p>\n\n[Armstrong - &quot;I would say that the Lunar Module flew better than the LLTV - fortunately. However, it was a reasonable simulation of the Lunar Module, and it was the best we had. The full-mission (but stationary) Lunar Module simulator worked very well, but the real in-flight situation provided by the LLTVs provided a reality that was hard to duplicate in a fixed-base simulator.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Also used in training and in the development of the landing systems was the Lunar Landing Research Facility - shown here with Neil standing in front of the LM mock-up. The facility consisted of a large, overhead gantry which allowed the cable-suspended LM mock-up to be moved forward and down - or up and back - in response to pilot input. The figure consists of a set of multiple exposures showing the mock-up as it comes in for a landing.  Two frames captured by Ken Glover from film of a training exercise in late June 1969 show rear and side views of the vehicle approaching touchdown.  Note that the 'craters' were painted on the flat tarmac.  Buzz 'flew' the LLRF on June 27 and 28; Neil on June 30.]<p>\n\n[In response to a 1997 question about his experience with the LLRF, Apollo 15 Commander Dave Scott offered the following: &quot;Ah yes, the LLRF -- what an experience! The LLRF was indeed a large Erector-Set structure at Langley (Research Center) that operated much as you indicated. It was intended to provide LLTV-type training without the risk and cost - although it must have cost a bunch! However, it was actually used very little compared to the LLTV for several reasons. I tried it several times and found it to be negative training, albeit well-intended. The major problem for me was the lag in response to control inputs. Even though they had some feed-forward loops and, at the time, some sophisticated control modes, the system could just not compensate for a vehicle swinging from a cable. Thus, the very short systems lag in a very dynamic and tight loop was just enough to confuse the human response -- which for LLTV-type flight was probably on the order of 0.2-to-0.5 seconds from input to expected output. It was an impressive-looking rig though! Should be a reasonable amout of documentation on the LLRF in the Langley files; and some of the old-timers should have some good stories. It was very important to Langley (as were a number of other Apollo-support activities, such as docking simulators), and the structure may even still be there!&quot;]<p>\n\n[Neil has provided some comments on the LLRF.  See, also, his comments about the LM engines during a panel discussion at the 1997 Naval Aviation Symposium.]<p>\n\n[We now move to discussion of the indoor, stationary simulator which was used as the primary training tool by the crews.]<p>\n\n[Aldrin - &quot;The (stationary) LM simulator was excellent in its fidelity of reproduction. As an example, we had the actual computer codes. Obviously, it was a simulation and the data the onboard computer used had to be generated somewhere; but, instead of that being generated in the simulator, it was done outside. It was a real test of the systems. Whoever made the decisions to do that made very wise ones. They're probably doing that more and more with simulators now. The level of detail in the LM and Command Module simulators for Apollo was unquestionably a pioneering effort that contributed significantly to how effective aircraft simulators and other situational simulators were later on.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Armstrong - &quot;It was extraordinary for its time and commercial aircraft simulators have undoubtedly benefited by duplicating the best parts.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Aldrin - &quot;Certainly the visual portrayal and, of course, the instrument activation.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Armstrong - &quot;What the LLTV gave you was not so much the seat-of-the-pants dynamics as the real-world visual. (Chuckling) That and the fact that, if you make a mistake, you can't hit the reset button.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Aldrin - &quot;I think it's important to stress the evolution of capabilities to accomplish the mission. The big difference I would point to between our mission and the later ones is that they had a much easier time landing. They could let the computer do a lot of stabilizing whereas we had to do a lot of that manually. Once we took over manually at 500 feet - which we had planned to do anyway - there was no way we could give it back to the computer. Whatever we had in the way of an attitude, it would hold. If it's accumulating a drift, it will get progressively worse unless you do something against it. On later systems, they closed the loop on it so that, if you let go of the controller, the computer would null translation. That made the descent on the later missions a lot easier to do - plus the fact that they weren't doing it for the first time.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Fjeld - &quot;The later crews never used this Auto mode. They all had to struggle with the controls as Neil did, except that they had his experience to draw on: they made sure they could see the shadow and that they were fat on fuel.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Aldrin - &quot;I think it's important, historically, to keep some of these differences (between missions) in mind. Sometimes, when the TV networks are doing an anniversary program, they jazz up the tension. They always take about 5 seconds off the amount of fuel you have left, and they never put it in the perspective of how much fuel the other flights had. They're not interested in that and I think that ought to be included.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Readers should note, however, that Neil's heart rate at touch down was 150 beats per minute, the highest of any of the Commanders. The need to avoid West Crater was probably a contributing factor, although the drama of the moment was undoubtedly played a role as well. See the discussion at 103:25:37.  In response to a question in 2002, Neil remembers that his resting heart rate &quot;was usually about 60&quot;.]</i>"

I was confused somewhat in that I couldn't really determine what my lateral velocities were due to the dust obscuration of the surface. I could see rocks and craters through this blowing dust. It was my intention to try and pick up a landing spot prior to the 100-foot mark and then pick out an area just beyond it such that I could keep my eyes on that all the way down through the descent and final touchdown. I wouldn't, in fact, be looking at the place (where) I was going to land; I would be looking at a place just (out) in front of it. That worked pretty well, but I was surprised that I had as much trouble as I did in determining translational velocities. I don't think I did a very good job of flying the vehicle smoothly in that period of time. I felt I was a little bit erratic.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Fjeld - &quot;Armstrong made about four quick pitch-down maneuvers, three of them totaling about 12 degrees in 2-3 seconds. They were well within the design control regime of the LM despite his apology that they were 'spasmodic'.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Neil came down through 100 feet at about 102:44:45 and landed at about 102:45:40. According to the Mission Report &quot;Landing on the surface occurred at 102:45:39.9 with negligible forward velocity, approximately 2.1 ft/sec to the crew's left, and 1.7 ft/sec vertically. Body rate transients (motions after first footpad touchdown) occurred and indicate that the right and forward landing gear touched almost simultaneously, giving a roll-left and a pitch-up motion to the vehicle. The left-directed lateral velocity resulted in a slight yaw right transient at the point of touchdown. These touchdown conditions, obtained from attitude rates and integration of acceleration data, were verified qualitatively, by the at-rest position of the lunar surface sensing probes and by surface build up around the rims of the footpads ( as photographed by the astronauts during the EVA).&quot;]<p>\n\n[The fact that the right and forward footpads hit first indicates that Neil was still trying to correct his left translation and to impart a little forward motion.]<p>\n\n[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I was feeding data to him all the time. I don't know what he was doing with it, but that was raw computer data.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;The computer data seemed to be pretty good information, and I would say that my visual perception of both altitude and altitude rate was not as good as I thought it was going to be. In other words, I was a little more dependent on the (computer) information. I think I probably could have made a satisfactory determination of altitude and altitude rate by eye alone, but it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be; and I think that it's not nearly so good as it is here on Earth.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I got the impression by just glimpsing out that we were at the altitude of seeing the shadow. Shortly after that, the horizon tended to be obscured by a tan haze. This may have been just an impression of looking down at a 45-degree angle. The depth of the material being kicked up seemed to be fairly shallow. In other words, it was scooting along the surface but, since particles were being picked up and moved along the surface, you could see little rocks of little protuberances coming up through this, so you knew that it was solid there. It wasn't obscured to that point, but it did tend to mask out your ability to detect motion because there was so much motion of things moving out. There were these few little islands that were stationary. If you could sort that out and fix on those, then you could tend to get the impression of being stationary. But that was quite difficult to do.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;It was a little bit like landing an airplane when there's a real thin layer of ground fog, and you can see things through the fog. However, all this fog was moving at a great rate, which was a little bit confusing.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I would think that it would be natural - looking out the left window and seeing this (dust) moving this way (left) - that you would get the impression of moving to the right, and you counteract by going to the left, which is how we touched down.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;Since we were moving left (toward the landing spot he had picked) , we were yawed slightly to the left so that I could get a good view of where we were going. I think we were yawed 13 degrees left; and, consequently, the shadow was not visible to me as it was behind the panel (Neil's window only gives a view from slightly right of forward around to 90 degrees left), but Buzz could see it. Then I saw it in the final phases of descent. I saw the shadow come into view, and it was a very good silhouette of the LM at the time I saw it. It was probably a couple of hundred feet out in front of the LM on the surface. (The shadow) is clearly a useful tool, but I just didn't get to observe it very long.&quot;]<p>\n\n[Figure 5-13 from the Apollo 11 Mission Report shows LM attitude (pitch, roll, and yaw) during the six seconds before the landing and the four seconds after.  At the begining of that interval, Neil had the LM yawed left 15 degrees, which increased to 16 degree during the final two seconds before the landing, and then decreased to 13 degress as the LM settled on the surface.]</i>"
